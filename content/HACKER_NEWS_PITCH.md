# Hacker News "Show HN" Pitch

## Submission Details
*   **Title:** Show HN: A privacy-first, zero-ad case converter that runs 100% in-browser
*   **URL:** https://convertcase.fast-api.workers.dev/

## The "First Comment" (Crucial for HN Context)
*Note: On HN, the founder should immediately post a comment explaining the "Why" and the technical stack.*

"I’ve always found it ironic that we use 'cloud' tools for the simplest text manipulations. Whenever I needed to fix the casing on a sensitive log file or a JSON export, I felt uneasy pasting it into ad-heavy sites that process everything server-side.

I built **Uppercase** to be a 'Zero-Knowledge' utility. 

**Key Technical Details:**
- **Local-Only:** 100% of the text processing happens in the browser via JS. No data is ever sent to a backend.
- **Privacy-First:** No ads, no invasive trackers.
- **Tech Stack:** Simple, vanilla JS for performance and auditability. It’s hosted on Cloudflare Workers as a static site.
- **Offline Capable:** You can load the site, disconnect your internet, and it will continue to function perfectly.

**Why?**
I wanted a tool that respects 'Flow State'—no popups, no lag, just the utility you need. My goal is to expand this into a suite of 'Data Janitor' tools (CSV cleaning, JSON formatting, etc.) that all follow this same local-first philosophy.

I'd love to hear your thoughts on the UI or any other 'small but annoying' text tasks you wish had a private, local-first solution."

## Strategic Advice for the HN Launch:
1.  **Timing:** Submit on Tuesday or Wednesday around 8:00 AM - 9:00 AM EST.
2.  **Be Present:** HN users love to ask technical questions (e.g., "How do you handle Title Case for different languages?"). Respond quickly and honestly.
3.  **No Voting Circles:** Don't ask friends to upvote it all at once; HN’s algorithm detects this and will "kill" the post. Let the growth be organic.
